Current work uses wood shavings from construction offcut waste or sourced from bark beetle killed trees to manufacture a new composite material with above code insulation standards, while also engineering a result which is sufficiently structurally strong to act as load bearing external walls for new energy efficient homes. 30 new homes have been successfully built in Australia with a prototype of this new building system. The Australian Managing Director will be available to provide support and guidance by skype conferencing for this Capstone project. California based staff will also provide backup for the project.","Engineering modelling and testing of the tensioning arrangement for tie down rods which compress the High Thermal Insulation Wall Blocks together. The individual High Thermal Insulation Wall Blocks are 24î long x 12î thick x 12î high. They have voids running through the blocks both vertically and horizontally. These blocks are not cemented together or held together by adhesive or filled with concrete. They are held together by 1/2îor 3/4î threaded rods running vertically through the voids in the blocks from the foundation to the roof structure. Seals between the blocks prevent any water or air leakage. This is a system similar to that used to hold the sections of the iconic Sydney Opera House sails together where cables are inserted into voids in the precast concrete elements and tensioned through the adjoining element to compress the whole together. At the top of the high thermal insulation wall a specially designed tension/compression plate (TC Plate) is installed which is shaped similar, but not identical to the horizontal void in the top of the blocks. Holes in the TC plate align with the position of the threaded tension rods. As the threaded rods are tensioned by tightening lock nuts down the threaded rods on to the TC plate, the TC plate will bend progressively as tension is increased to the point where the TC plate conforms to the depth of the void in the top of the block. This process of bending the TC plate to the depth of the void in the top of the block is to be engineered to match the tension required in the tension rods to compress the wall together giving it the ability to resist building loads and forces generated by wind and seismic movement. This bending of the TC plate is engineered by selection of the thickness of the folded sheet metal section and by the amount of bending required of the TC plate to conform to the depth of top brick void. The tension plate therefore acts as a spring and tension gauge which can also accommodate some expansion and contraction in the tension rods due to temperature changes. A tension plate with these characteristics will ensure that the correct tension is applied to all tension rods and is done so in a way which requires no measuring gauges or other specialist measuring technology on site, thereby simplifying and speeding the process of compressing the wall to the desired amount. The brick and tension plate arrangement are illustrated on the attached images.",This project requires the Capstone team to: 1) Model the design of the tension plate to determine a suitable thickness for the folded sheet metal tension plate and the degree to which the tension plate must bend to conform to the depth of the void. 2) Validate the modelling in 1) above by fabricating a full size tension plate and applying a measured tension to confirm that the tension plate operates as intended. Tension values required will be advised by T3Energy/SIGBT.,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D5Z2zP5gJEseNakOklUaJhHLkWwatAQs

Bowles continuously strives to implement new technology to improve processes and activities around the farm.,"Milkweed is a native species in the Californiaís Central Valley and is a critical element in Monarch habitat, as it provides both forage for adult butterflies and protection for developing larvae. With changes in California land use pressures, milkweed populations have declined, contributing to a correlating decline in monarch populations. Milkweed seed is naturally distributed via pappus (like a dandelion) and when collected, is a mixture of floss and seed. Today, most milkweed is collected by hand, which is a costly and inefficient process. New methods need to be developed for both harvesting and cleaning milkweed seeds in order to efficiently meet the habitat demands of the species.","Milkweed harvesting is the most intensive effort in the production. Milkweed seed is most often collected by hand, and occasionally, via combine. There are significant disadvantages to both. Hand collection of milkweed seed is cost-prohibitive when considering the environmental demands, and combining seed results in the collection of immature materials and can damage the milkweed plants. A successful solution should (1) be mechanized, (2) minimize damage to milkweed plants, and (3) be scalable.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WIGSf1i-TJHG4UmFqoExmPyJi3qhMIl1

The system encompasses 121 miles of track, of which 32 miles are aerial, 61 miles are at grade and about 28 miles underground.","With such an extensive wayside network, BART faces the constant challenge of maintaining track clearance and functionality, particularly along uncovered outdoor routes. Track obstructions such as tree branches and garbage pose fire hazards and can cause the train control system to register the presence of a nonexistent train on the trackway, known as a ""false occupancy."" Avoidance of operational delays is critical. Other obstructions include stray animalsóand even the occasional humanótrespassing wayside. Although relatively rare, these occurrences delay service, causing late arrivals and missed transit connections for passengers.","The goal of this project is to improve BART's ability to manage track obstructions via an apparatus or procedure that reduces the time taken to detect and address these issues. The focus will be on aerial and at-grade track. As part of the successful completion of this effort, the project team will deliver both a functional prototype and a report describing the technology involved. The report must provide comprehensive specifications including the following: accuracyóhow accurate and precise the detection mechanism is; Speedóboth how fast the mechanism deploys and the speed at which inspection is carried out; obstruction typeówhat kinds of objects would be identified; range; maintainability ease of use and dependability; and financial impact to BART operations.

20190064,6,6/10/19,Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART),Jessica,Lovett,JLovett@bart.gov,4564564567,sent,Tracking Inspection Apparatus,"BART maintains over 121 miles of track comprising six lines spread over four counties. The system provides service to over 400,000 average daily riders and is a vital piece of the Bay Areaís transportation infrastructure. Although system components are built for strength and longevity, normal wear and tear is unavoidable. This is especially true as increased ridershipóBART carries more than ten times as many passengers as it did in the early 1970sótakes its toll on equipment, structures, trains, and track. As part of BARTís commitment to safe and efficient service, tracks and their components are inspected for misalignment, cracks, fractures, corrosion, wear, and other defects and damage.","Track inspections occur during non-revenue service hours, which has some drawbacks: because the work can only be done within a limited window each night, coordinating with staff schedules can be difficult and reduced visibility increases the potential for human error. Furthermore, any use of personnel on the trackway carries a certain amount of risk to worker safety.","BART is looking for innovative ideas to address the difficulties of nighttime track inspections. How can the process be made safer and more efficient? Can the current system be improved, augmented, or redesigned to meet these goals? Is there a way to reduce the need for inspection staff along the right-of-way, or can technology be developed to make on-site human involvement unnecessary? The proposed solution must have the ability to travel along BARTís nonstandard (5í 6î gage) rail lines quickly and safely, as well as observe and detect problem areas. It must then note, flag, record, and report issues back to technical staff in a timely and accurate manner. The system may include the use of automated or robotic devices equipped with cameras, sensors, or other tools to detect defects and damage to the trackway. These devices could operate alongside or be remotely controlled by inspectors. Finally, the proposed solution should be reliable, resilient, simple to maintain, and represent an improvement on current maintenance processes. Mechanical and computer science engineering students will find this to be an exciting and rewarding chance to develop innovative ideas, learn valuable skills, and help improve the operations of a vital public transport system.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SwqUdNhAW7Up2JZLftbfOshIDHdf-6Lz

In addition to transit-facing spaces such as ticketing zones, concourses, and platforms, many stations also contain open, outdoor areas that fulfill some of the same functions as public parksóplaces where community members meet, spend time, and participate in neighborhood life.","Though BART works to maintain these public spaces in line with community standards of cleanliness and safety, upkeep is a constant challenge. Exposure to the elements plus normal wear and tear combine with vandalism, littering, and other consequences of heavy use to make cleaning a near-constant job. Garbage and grime create unpleasant odors, are an eyesore, and are a potential biohazard risk to patrons and staff.","This project will continue an effort begun last year to mitigate the effects of uncleanliness and contamination in BART plazas, with an emphasis on odor abatement. In fall 2018, the UC Merced team proposed a machine to draw in outside air, run it through deodorizing liquid, and spray a fine mist of fresh air into the surrounding area. Concepts and schematics were developed, and a simulation was conducted to determine the machineís maximum odor-reducing range in an enclosed environment. However, the simulation did not take into account all the variables of a large open-air plaza, and the system has not yet been implemented. This project will expand on the work done last fall, with the new team building a prototype of the odor removal system and running additional tests to determine its effective range in BARTís public plazas. Modifications to the fall 2018 teamís recommendation to eliminate unpleasant odors or a new machine may also be developed. The new proposal must be innovative, economical, and effective. It must also be designed to withstand the test of time, and not put undue burden on maintenance resources in the futur ódependability, sturdiness, and ease of use should be prioritized.

However, one element of BARTís infrastructure that is often overlooked does not run on elevated platforms or in underground tunnels, but in between the two: sidewalks and other ground-level paved surfaces.","BART works hard to maintain these surfaces. But over time, they can become damaged due to heavy loads as well as natural phenomena like tree roots and seismic activity. The resulting cracks, unevenness, and sloped planes are then a safety risk to riders and staff alike. Surface defects must be repaired to prevent tripping and allow the maneuverability of wheelchairs and other wheeled conveyances to meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines. BART takes the safety and accessibility of its facilities very seriously, and ease of access for people with disabilities is of particular importance.","This project will address the problem of uneven and cracked paved surfaces in and around BART stations and facilities. The successful solution will be innovative, cost effective, and robust, with a focus on durability and ease of future maintenance. The solution will also need to enhance and be easily incorporated into existing maintenance practices, and take into account the full range of ground surface materials employed at BART sites including concrete, tile, brick, and asphalt. The proposal may utilize substances or machinery to patch, wedge, grind, or cut the paved surfaces in order to temporarily or permanently fix the problem. However, it cannot simply consist of a recommendation for off-the-shelf equipment or materials; in keeping with the spirit of Innovate to Grow, the project must showcase creativity, originality, and engineering abilities.

Today, TID provides irrigation water to more than 5,800 growers in a 307 square-mile service area that incorporates 149,500 acres of irrigable Central Valley farmland. TID also provides electricity to houses, farmers, businesses, and industrial and municipal customers in a 662 square-mile service area that includes portions of Stanislaus, Merced, Tuolumne, and Mariposa counties. Included in TID's infrastructure is a Water Treatment Plan located in La Grange, California. The Water Treatment Plant system is composed of a raw water pump station, water treatment processing facility, and finish water storage tanks. The system treats water and delivers it to the residents of La Grange for domestic and fire protection needs.","Drainage from TIDís irrigation operations flows to the San Joaquin River through facilities that are located in the vicinity of the Riverís eastern bank. The drainage facilities typically consist of earthen canals and metal culverts that convey the drainage through the flood protection levees and into the River. Migrating adult salmon and other fish species in the River occasionally mistake these drainage flows as natural streams, swim into the drainage facilities and become stranded. When this occurs, attempts are made to rescue the fish before they expire.","The team will be required to develop a viable solution to prevent fish from entering two of TIDís drainage facilities, known as the Harding Drain and the Nielsen Drain. A challenging factor associated with this issue is that the Harding Drain and Nielsen Drain also convey a significant amount of aquatic weeds to the River. Aquatic weeds are undesirable plants that grow and reproduce in irrigation and drainage systems that, among other things, impede flow capacity. TIDís aquatic weed abatement program sends a significant amount of weeds down the canal system, into the drains and to the River. Therefore, while any proposed solution must prevent fish from entering the drains from the River, the solution must also allow the aquatic weeds to continue to flow to the River or remove the aquatic weeds in a cost-effective manner.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SOHb-OdIHw3qpQHeNzNhtE5usAivsCUX
